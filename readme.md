# Neural network content-based Recommendation model 

## <a href="https://movies-recommender-tau.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Live version</a>

Using users (e.g., preferences for each of the defined genres (0-5)) and movies (e.g., binary attribute indicating whether or not a movie is part of a certain genre (1.0)) content, train the model to predict movie recommendations. In this case specifically, since we are not going to have users, we are going to focus on how similar a movie is to other movies.

The dataset contains: 
- **847** movies
- **397** users
- **14** genres
- **25,521** ratings

**Feature engineering is applied repeating some ratings to boost underrepresented genres.**

## Goal

Compute the distance between movies using the features trained by the neural network model. This distance is saved in a **2D matrix** so that the calculation of the distance is as follows:

**i**: Movie<sub>i</sub> index in the matrix

**j**: Movie<sub>j</sub> index in the matrix 

**distance**: matrix[i][j]

<br/>

In order to improve the accuracy of the recommendation, instead of just picking the closest movie from **movie<sub>i</sub>**, say **movie<sub>j</sub>**, we can take a list of movies and compute the sum of the distance from the movies in the list with each movie in the dataset. After that, we take the least sum.

One disadvantage of the approach defined above is that it might give inaccurate predictions for a movie list that is too sparse, i.e., movies are not similar. Otherwise, it can be efficient for finding a similar movie with more accuracy.

The **UI implementation follows the exact method defined above**, allowing the user to pick 3 movies. 

## Results

You can find the recommendation UI is deployed <a href="https://movies-recommender-tau.vercel.app/" target="_blank">here</a>

In the output folder you can find:

- **recommendations_movies_data.json**: The data for all movies used for training and for prediction. This is generated by the **scripts/populate-recommendations.js** file.

- **recommendations.json**: The recommendations matrix used for generating recommendations. This is the result from the training notebook **recommender.ipynb**.

- **top_movies.json**: The list of the most rated movies ids, i.e, most popular. This is generated by the **scripts/top-most-rated.js** file. Also, these are the movies displayed on the UI.
